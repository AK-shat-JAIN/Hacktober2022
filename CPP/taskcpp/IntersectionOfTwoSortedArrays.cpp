//You are given two arrays 'A' and 'B' of size 'N' and 'M' respectively. Both these
// arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order. You have to find the intersection of
// these two arrays.
// Intersection of two arrays is an array that consists of all the common elements
// occurring in both arrays.

//Note:
// 1. The length of each array is greater than zero.
// 2. Both the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
// 3. The output should be in the order of elements that occur in the original arrays.
// 4. If there is no intersection present then return an empty array.

// Input Format:
// The first line of the input contains an integer 'T', denoting the number of test cases.
// The first line of each test case contains two integers 'N' 'M', denoting the size of the two arrays.
// The second line of each test case contains 'N' space-separated integers denoting the elements of the first array.
// The third line of each test case contains 'M' space-separated integers denoting the elements of the second array.

//Output Format:
// The only line of output of each test case contains 'K' space-separated integers which correspond to the intersection of the two arrays A and B.
// The output of each test case will be printed on a separate line.
